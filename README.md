# Mycotoxin Prediction using Hyperspectral Imaging Data

**Enhance agricultural safety with cutting-edge machine learning techniques!**

This project leverages hyperspectral imaging data to predict mycotoxin levels in corn samples. By processing spectral reflectance data, reducing its dimensions via PCA, and training a 1D CNN for regression (with an optional classification adaptation), this solution provides actionable insights into potential contamination levels.

## Features

- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
  - Load and inspect hyperspectral data for missing values and inconsistencies.
  - Standardize spectral reflectance values across multiple wavelength bands.
  - Visualize spectral characteristics using line plots and heatmaps.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  - Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce feature dimensions.
  - Visualize the reduced data with 2D scatter plots and assess variance explained.

- **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  - Build and train a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression.
  - Evaluate model performance with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
  - (Optional) Adapt the model for classification with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and a confusion matrix.

## Usage Examples

**Data Visualization:**
- Inspect average spectral reflectance trends with line plots.
- Explore feature correlations via heatmaps.

**Dimensionality Reduction:**
- Visualize the 2D PCA-reduced data to understand clustering and variance.

**Model Training:**
- Train the 1D CNN to predict mycotoxin levels (vomitoxin_ppb).
- Evaluate regression metrics and compare actual vs. predicted values.
- (Optional) Convert to a classification problem and assess performance with classification metrics and a confusion matrix.
